Build a full React Native Expo app named “Link” (service marketplace + profiles).

TECH STACK
- Frontend: React Native (Expo, TypeScript), React Navigation
- UI: react-native-paper (or NativeWind if easier)
- Auth: Google Sign-In (Expo + Firebase Auth)
- Database: Firebase Firestore
- Storage: Firebase Storage (for profile/service images)
- i18n: i18next + react-i18next
- Currency: store money in a base currency + format using Intl.NumberFormat

CORE CONCEPT
Users can browse professionals (Doctor, Translator, Plumber, Tour Guide, Driver, Shop, Other).
Professionals can create a profile + services.
Shop users can create multiple products, manage stock, and link with delivery people (“Delivery Link” professionals).

SCREENS / FLOW
A) Landing / Home (first screen)
- Title: “What you are looking for…”
- Search box (search by name, professional type, keywords)
- Under search: a grid of icon buttons like a mobile home screen
  Icons represent professional types (Doctor, Translator, Plumber, Tour Guide, Driver, Shop, Other)
- When user taps an icon -> go to “Results List” filtered by that type
- When user searches -> go to Results List with query

B) Results List
- List of professionals (card view): avatar/photo, name, professionalType, short description, wage + currency
- Tap a card -> Professional Detail screen

C) Professional Detail
- If user is NOT logged in: show a gate screen:
  “Please log in with Google to view contact details”
  Button: “Continue with Google”
- If logged in: show contact + full profile:
  Phone number, Address, wage (hourly/daily), gallery images, services list
- Button: “Contact” (show phone + optionally open dialer)

D) My Profile (for logged-in user)
- If new user: prompt to create profile
- Profile form:
  - Select professionalType dropdown first
  - If “Other”, show extra input box “Specify your profession”
  - Phone, Address, Wage type + Wage amount, Currency
  - Upload images (multiple)
  - Languages (multi-select)
  - Publish toggle

E) Shop Management (only if professionalType = Shop)
- Products tab:
  - Create/Edit/Delete products
  - Manage stock (increment/decrement, set stock)
- Delivery Links tab:
  - Browse “Delivery” professionals
  - Send link request
  - Show pending/accepted links

F) Settings
- Language switch (en/th/my) with i18n
- Currency display preference (still store in profile currency but allow viewer formatting)
- Logout

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
- Search:
  - Filter by professional type and text search (name/description). If full text is hard, implement “startsWith” search + type filter for MVP.
- Auth:
  - Google sign-in required only when viewing contact details (Phone/Address) OR when creating/editing profile
- Security Rules (basic):
  - users/profiles: user can write their own doc only
  - services/products: only owner can write
  - public read allowed for published profiles/services/products

PROJECT SETUP IN REPLIT
- Provide a working Expo project
- Add README with:
  - how to run (npm install, npm run start)
  - how to set up Firebase env values in app config (EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*)
  - where to add Google auth config

DELIVERABLES
- Complete codebase with folder structure:
  /src
    /screens
    /components
    /navigation
    /services (firebase.ts, queries.ts)
    /i18n
    /types
- Navigation wired up
- Seed/demo data script (optional) or simple “Create sample profile” dev button

Start by generating the project scaffold, then implement screens in order: Landing -> Results -> Detail (with auth gate) -> My Profile -> Shop Management -> Settings -> i18n.
